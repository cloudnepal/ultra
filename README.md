# SNPM (WIP)
SNPM is an "alternative" for NPM, but it's not meant to replace NPM/Yarn/PNPM

**DISCLAIMER ðŸš§**

This project was made to learn more about Package Managers, for now you should only use it to play with it.

## CLI
The SNPM CLI is used to install packages from the package.json of a project.

Its advantages are that it is faster than NPM and saves more space.

### Instalation
```bash
npm i @snpm-io/cli -g
```

### Commands
- `snpm install` Installs packages from package.json
- `snpm benchmark` Tests SNPM against NPM and PNPM
- `snpm clear` Remove .snpm-cache folder

### Todo
- [ ] Make it work in some JS Frameworks
- [x] Fix monorepos integration (Tested with this Monorepo)

### Why is it faster?
SNPM uses the same installation system as PNPM, fetch dependency, download dependency. Without waiting for the rest of the dependencies.

To resolve the dependencies, a dependency tree is generated as in NPM version 2, each dependency (or subdependency) has its own `node_modules`.

Now you are probably wondering how that makes the space more efficient than in NPM.

Each dependency is a symbolic link to a common store inside `.snpm-cache`, so all your projects use shared dependencies.

### It works?
Short answer, probably no, but in some cases it works. (For now)

I've selected some quickstart templates to test SNPM, and I'm working on make it work in all of them.

If you want to test a template, you can use Vite, I've already tested it and it should work.
