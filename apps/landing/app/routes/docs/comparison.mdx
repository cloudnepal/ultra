# ULTRA vs NPM / Yarn

> Yarn is Yarn Classic.

## What's the difference between ULTRA and NPM / Yarn?

The main difference between ULTRA and NPM / Yarn is the dependency resolution algorithm. NPM / Yarn gets all the dependencies first and then installs them. ULTRA gets one dependency at a time and installs it. This means that ULTRA can install dependencies faster than NPM / Yarn.

Also ULTRA installs all the packages inside a global store (as PNPM does) and creates a hardlink to the package inside the project's node_modules folder. This means that ULTRA doesn't need to install the same package twice if it's used in multiple projects.

## It works?

It depends. ULTRA is still in development and it's not ready for production yet. It's not recommended to use it in production yet.

You can test for example, with a Next or a Vite project and it should work.

## How much faster is ULTRA than NPM / Yarn?

Varies depending on the number of project dependencies.

If the proyect has a few dependencies, for example Vite quickstart, clean installs are almost the same. Installs with cache are much faster with ULTRA.

If the project has a lot of dependencies, for example Next.js, ULTRA is much faster.

You can check the benchmarks in the closed PR's comments.

## What's the difference between ULTRA and PNPM?

Although similar, Ultra and PNPM have some differences.

Both use a shared store to store dependencies and reuse them in different projects on your computer.

The most visible difference is the structure of the Node Modules, PNPM creates a folder inside that is called `.pnpm`, there it stores the dependencies that later creates symbolic links to the parent folder.

Ultra creates a structure similar to the one created in NPM, Yarn or Bun.

To better understand how PNPM works, we recommend to take a look at its [documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation#creating-a-non-flat-node_modules-directory)

In terms of speed, PNPM is faster than Ultra in clean installations, but Ultra is faster in installations with Cache or lockfile.

If you are working on a production project, we recommend you to use PNPM, in fact, until Ultra is stable, we use PNPM to manage our repository.

## Does it work in Monorepos?

Monorepos support is still in development and may not work as expected. [#45](https://github.com/nachoaldamav/ultra/issues/45)
