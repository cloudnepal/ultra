# ULTRA vs NPM / Yarn

## What's the difference between ULTRA and NPM / Yarn?

The main difference between ULTRA and NPM / Yarn is the dependency resolution algorithm. NPM / Yarn gets all the dependencies first and then installs them. ULTRA gets one dependency at a time and installs it. This means that ULTRA can install dependencies faster than NPM / Yarn.

Also ULTRA installs all the packages inside a global store (as PNPM does) and creates a hardlink to the package inside the project's node_modules folder. This means that ULTRA doesn't need to install the same package twice if it's used in multiple projects.

## It works?

It depends. ULTRA is still in development and it's not ready for production yet. It's not recommended to use it in production yet.

You can test for example, with a Next or a Vite project and it should work.

## ULTRA doesn't verify the integrity of the packages?

Yes, it doesn't. That's because how ULTRA works, I didn't think it was necessary to verify the integrity of the packages.

It's because the lockfile created by ULTRA only uses paths. 

I've created a "Discussion" in the Github repository to talk about this [here](https://github.com/nachoaldamav/ultra/discussions/44)

## How much faster is ULTRA than NPM?

Varies depending on the number of project dependencies.

If you have a project with many dependencies ULTRA will be faster than NPM / Yarn. If you have a project with few dependencies, NPM / Yarn will probably be faster than ULTRA.

With a clean installation, ULTRA should be faster than NPM / Yarn, 2x faster in some cases.

## Does it work in Monorepos?

Currently, it doesn't. I'm working on it. [#45](https://github.com/nachoaldamav/ultra/issues/45)
