# Getting started

This is a quick start guide to start using FNPM to install packages.

```bash
npm install -g @fnpm-io/cli
```

## Usage

To install packages from `package.json` you have to run the following command:

```bash
fnpm install
```

You can also install packages from the command line:

```bash
fnpm install lodash # You can also use flags like -D
```
